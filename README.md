# Paws Markdown parser
don't use this.

it's a scuffed markdown parser that I use for my blog, 
if you want some examples of what it parses go to [https://sirpaws.dev](https://sirpaws.dev) and pick a post, then replace the `POST_NAME.html` with `md/POST_NAME.md`

also, I might remove some of the meta tokens (like `#[pdf-header-left]`), and use frontmatter instead

# How do I build it?
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
